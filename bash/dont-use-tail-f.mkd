# Use `less +F` instead of `tail -f`

Why? You can switch stream and search mode without leaving less. For example, while
reading a file stream you can make a regular search by hitting `Ctrl-c` and
using slash (`/`) to seek for a word. To switch back to stream mode hit F.

To see all the options available just read `man less`.
