# Help Navigation

Everyone knows that the :help command is extremely useful. Especially if you learn how to navigate these files like a freaking ninja.
Every decent help starts with a little index, right? so, did you know that you can jump directly to those indexes?
Just put your cursor over the topic and hit:
```vimscript
Ctrl + ]
```
Awesome, but you are too dumb and jumped to the wrong place. No problem, just hit
```vimscript
Ctrl + O
```
to undo your navigation
